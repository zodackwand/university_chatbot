You are expected to engage fully with your course and you are required to attend all lectures, seminars / tutorials, laboratories, and meetings with your tutors. A register will be taken at each seminar and workshop session and attendance will be recorded in Tabula. 

If illness means you are unable to attend a seminar or workshop you must send your apologies to the seminar/workshop tutor, preferably in advance, and find out how you can catch up on the work. 

As a student you must: 
◾commit to engage fully with your course your intellectual commitment is vital to your success and to creating a productive learning environment for others; 
◾ensure that you dedicate sufficient time to your studies; 
◾attend all timetabled sessions and engage fully with their content; 
◾engage fully with opportunities for supplementary studying and independent learning available to you. 

To repeat - students should note that attendance at seminars / tutorials and laboratories should be treated as mandatory unless otherwise advised. If a student fails to attend one of these classes they may be required to submit additional coursework or sit additional examinations. 

Monitoring Points
To help us to gauge how successfully you are engaging with your course, identify any problems which you may be experiencing, and offer support to help you, the department has a number of check points (“monitoring points”) throughout the year. Monitoring points include meetings with personal tutors, attendance at certain classes, submission of assessed work and attendance at examinations. If you miss any of the points, this might indicate that you are having problems with the course and need additional support. These monitoring points are available to see on Tabula. 

It is extremely important that you meet the requirements of each point as failure to do so could initially result in a formal letter being sent to you from Student Records reminding you of your obligations as a student. If you continue to miss monitoring points without good reason you may even be required to withdraw from your course. More detailed information about attendance can be found here: 

Reg. 36 Student Registration, Attendance and Progress

International students should be particularly aware of the consequences of missing monitoring and other contact points: the Academic Office is obliged to report to the Home Office UK Visas and Immigration (formerly the UK Border Agency) if students on a visa under the Student Route (previously known as Tier 4 Student Visa) have been found not to be engaging with and attending their degree course. This will normally lead to the curtailment of their visas. 

Please speak initially to your Personal Tutor if you feel you might be at risk of not meeting these critical requirements at any point during your university career.

It is hoped that this approach to monitoring progress allows the Department to identify early on students who are having difficulties with the course or with adjusting to University study. 

Different degree programmes and different years of study have different monitoring points, and a detailed list of monitoring points is available to each student on Tabula. 

If you are having problems with study or otherwise for any reason, including illness, you should seek help or advice at an early stage, rather than letting things deteriorate until the problems become severe. Please speak with your Personal Tutor in the first instance. 

Absence Through Illness 
Students are expected to inform the Department of any health problems, changes in circumstances or other difficulties that may affect their progress. If a student fails to inform the Department, these circumstances cannot be taken into account.

The University has a policy regarding sickness absence for students. In brief, this states that students should self-certify absences due to sickness for absences of up to seven days, except where the absence is at a time of significant assessment (e.g. examinations). A doctor’s note/medical certificate is required for absences of longer than seven days and for examination purposes.

Cancellation of Classes 
In the event that a teaching session must be cancelled or rescheduled, students will be notified by e-mail and through the Teaching Announcements webpage. If a teaching session is cancelled at short notice, a note will be placed on the venue doors if possible.
