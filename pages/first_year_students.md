Starting university is an exciting and sometimes overwhelming experience. This page summarises the essential information new first year undergraduates need to know. However, this is not a substitute for reading all other sections of the Student Handbook, which all students in the Department of Computer Science are required to do.

Contact details for all staff are listed on the People page of the departmental website. From time-to-time you may need to refer to the list of Staff Responsibilities. Contact details for your Personal Tutor can be found on Tabula, under “Profiles” --> “My profile” --> “Personal Tutor.”

Understanding your course requirements
Core Modules, Optional Modules and Credit Weightings (CATS)
Each course is made up of different modules, which are like subjects. Modules are grouped into Core Modules and Optional Modules. Modules have a credit weighting. These are usually 15 CATS credits, though you may see 60, 30, 24, 12, 10, 7.5 and 6 CATS credits modules in other departments.

You need to complete a certain number of CATS credits each year. The normal load for each year of an undergraduate degree programme is 120 CATS. Note that 120 CATS is the minimum, and students are not allowed to "underload". Like most science departments at Warwick, the Department of Computer Science allows students to take modules amounting to more than 120 CATS credits per year, but not more than 150 CATS credits. However, an overload (any load more than 120 CATS credits) is not recommended in the first year. You can find the module structure (including any regulations you may need to follow) for your year and degree on the course structures page.

Usual and Unusual Options
The Optional Modules listed in the course structures are sometimes referred to as Usual Options. Most first year students will select modules from this list, in addition to their Core Modules, to make their total load at least 120 CATS. In designing the timetable, the Department seeks to minimise the clashes with these modules and the rest of your timetable. However, there is not enough available time in the teaching week to avoid all clashes! If there are clashes in your timetable, you should speak to the relevant Module Organisers to see what can be arranged.

Modules that are not listed as Core or Optional for your course are referred to as Unusual Options, e.g., modules offered to students on other courses. If you would like to take an Unusual Option, you should discuss this with your Personal Tutor and/or Course Director. If you are agreed, then there is a form which you must fill in. The Unusual Option scheme requires the formal agreement of the Module Organiser and the Director of Undergraduate Studies in Computer Science. Descriptions of modules offered by other departments may be found on the respective departmental web sites. First year students should only take level 1 modules (the first digit of the module code will be ʻ1ʼ).

Transferring between courses
Transfers from Computer Systems Engineering to Computer Science, Computer Science with Business Studies, Discrete Mathematics or Data Science are not allowed.

It may be possible to transfer between Computer Science, Discrete Mathematics and Data Science. The deadline to do this is the end of week 2, term 1. After this deadline, any switch will need to be by course restart. Course restarts will only be considered if the student would have received an offer if they had initially applied to the degree course they are looking to transfer to. Please note that meeting the course entry requirements would not guarantee an offer.

Students can transfer from Computer Science to Computer Science with Business Studies up to end of second year provided the student has met the requirements for transfer. More information on the Computer Science with Business Studies course can be found on the Computer Science with Business Studies webpage.

Studying at University
Learning at University differs significantly from what you might be used to in school. You are expected to take much more responsibility for your learning. Module Organisers will provide guidance, but you are expected to manage your time, attend taught sessions, and complete assessments. Unlike school, where teachers may frequently check on your progress, you must be proactive about seeking help.

Get familiar with your timetable, available via Tabula, and attend all your lectures, seminars, and labs. These are essential for understanding the course material. Your timetable is likely to be more flexible, with fewer contact hours that you are used to. This means you need to manage your time effectively to keep up with your studies.

Attendance at lectures is not monitored but is expected. Attendance at lab and seminar sessions is monitored. These sessions will have a register, and attendance of these sessions will form part of the monitoring point systemLink opens in a new window (This link will be added 18th Sept '24).

Regularly check your student email. Important information about your course, modules, events, and opportunities will be sent there.

Lectures, Seminars and Labs
Lectures are the main form of content delivery within most of your modules. Most lectures will last 50 minutes, though some modules may make use of double lectures – which are two 50-minute sessions with a 10-minute break in the middle. Lectures are typically information heavy, with lecturers presenting material on a particular topic. We are an international community, and this means you will experience different styles of teaching. Many lecturers will use slides during their lectures, others may use a whiteboard, chalkboard, or an overhead projector. Most modules will have some form of handout available before the lecture, often on the module webpages, the Online Material for Modules webpage or on the Moodle webpages. The Module Organiser(s) should inform you where you can find resources. Lectures can be anywhere on campus. You can use the interactive campus map to find rooms and get walking directions from anywhere on campus to anywhere else. Lectures can be fast paced, so taking good notes is crucial.

Lecture capture refers to a recording of a given lecture made available after the session for revision. The department does not require modules to provide lecture capture, but many do. Providing lecture capture is down to individual module organiser discretion. If lecture capture is provided, it should not be seen as a replacement for attending the lecture in person.

Seminars are smaller classes – ideally between 20 and 40 students – where you can expect to cover material in more depth. Seminars will often involve a seminar tutor going through exercises and questions. These questions will often be released before the seminar, with the expectation that a student attempts the questions before the seminar session. Seminars are a great opportunity to test your knowledge of the module so far and help augment your understanding. You will find seminars much more beneficial if you attempt the questions beforehand, as it will allow you to engage with the session more actively.

Laboratory sessions, often referred to as ‘labs,’ are smaller class sessions with a focus on practical elements of the course. There will typically take place in our lab rooms on the ground floor of the DCS Building. These sessions will involve working on an assessment, worksheet or other practical lab work and will usually utilise tools, programming languages and applications discussed within the lecture material. Students are expected engage with these sessions, as they will help cultivate key skills, usually needed for the assessment of the module. These sessions will be led by a lab tutor – typically the Module Organiser or a Teaching Assistant. They will be there to help with implementation issues and to guide your processes. Labs are a great place to get immediate, direct help with a particular tool or approach.

Examination and Assessment
It is important to understand how you will be assessed. The assessment of individual modules varies from being continuously assessed (e.g. by coursework or project report, through a combination of continuous assessment and written examination), to being totally assessed by written examination. Each module description specifies the mode of assessment and, if it is by written examination, the time allowed for the examination.

The university grading system may be different from what you are used to. More information can be found in the Assessment section. You may be used to getting marks of 90–100%, but this is very unlikely to happen at university. Marks in the 50–70% range are perfectly normal.

All examinations in the Department of Computer Science will be held on-campus in-person. Please check carefully if you are taking examinations in other departments as some departments have different exam arrangements. More information can be found on the Assessments page, the Examination Advice page, and with the Modules, Marks and Assessments Team page

Examinations for most modules are held during the second half of the third term, however the exam for MA142 (core for DM) is held in January and CS118 and CS130 (core for CS (Computer Sciences)), and MA138 (core for DM) are held during the first week of the third term. Modules provided by outside departments may be held at other times; all students, particularly those following joint courses, should ensure they are aware of the timing of examinations for all modules that they are following.

Note that some examinations may be scheduled on Saturdays. Examination scheduling is organised by Student Administrative Services not the Department of Computer Science. Please see the Modules, Marks, and Assessment Team website for timetable publication dates. Please be aware of the deadline for declaring religious observance on the Modules Marks and Assessments webpage.

The decision on whether you have passed your first year, and may be permitted to proceed to the second year, is made by the DCS Year 1 Board of Examiners.

The overall pass mark for the year is 40%, but it is also necessary to achieve a satisfactory performance (at least 40%) in all required core modules to proceed to the second year of the course.

For those who do not pass at the first attempt there are re-sit examinations, which are expected to take place at the beginning of September. Module results are capped at 40% for resitting students. To progress to year 2 of the course, resit candidates are required to achieve an overall mark of 40% or above for Year 1 in addition to passing any required resit examinations. Please note that travel and accommodation costs must be met out of your own funds.

Study Skills
Study skills encompass the academic and professional skills which enable you to succeed at university. Study skills include reading, note-taking, critical thinking, planning, writing, referencing, presentation, revision, and examination skills. You will also have to manage a significant amount of independent study.

You have probably used some of these skills before in your studies and personal life but may find that the standard expected at university is much higher.

You will cover some of these skills in CS133 Professional Skills, and the library offers several helpful resources too.

Health and Wellbeing
Make sure you register with the University of Warwick Health Centre.

Starting University can be stressful and Wellbeing and Student Support provide a range of services that can help you to develop the personal resources and skills you need to navigate the challenges and opportunities of student life.

You should also try to maintain a healthy diet and exercise regularly. Warwick Sport provides access to some amazing indoor and outdoor spaces, facilities, and range of activities. If sport is not your thing, Warwick SU (Student Union) has over 250 societies covering a wide range of student interests, so there is bound to be one for you!

Students must inform the Department (via Mitigating Circumstances) if any circumstances have affected their study (such as illness or personal circumstances) before the relevant Board of Examiners meets.

Final Thoughts
Learning at University is a journey that requires more independence, critical thinking, and time management than you may have experienced before. However, it is also an incredibly rewarding time where you can explore your interests in depth, develop now skills, and prepare for your future career.

University is about more than just studying. Make the most of the opportunities that the University offers and take the time to enjoy being part of diverse international community.

Your first year is a time of adjustment. Be patient with yourself as you settle in, and do not forget to ask for help if you need it.

If you are struggling, speak to your personal tutor as soon as possible. They will signpost you towards the relevant people, whether than be the Senior Tutors, Wellbeing and Student Support, the Module Organiser(s) or someone else.
