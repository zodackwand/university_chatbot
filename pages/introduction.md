Welcome to the Department of Computer Science. We are a consistently top-ranked department, which is known for combining excellence in research with high quality teaching and learning. We have built up a reputation for being a friendly and supportive department that encourages students from a wide range of backgrounds to achieve their potential.

The Department provides a number of degree courses at undergraduate and postgraduate level. There are undergraduate courses in Computer Science, Discrete Mathematics, Computer Science with Business Studies, and Computer Systems Engineering. Each of these courses is available with an ‘Intercalated Year’ variant, where students spend one year on industrial placement or study abroad, usually following their penultimate year of study. The Department also contributes to BSc Data Science. For postgraduates, we offer two full-time taught courses, MSc Computer Science and MSc Data Analytics.

The educational aims of all the courses we offer are similar; to develop the analytical, communication and subject-specific skills of students to enable them to contribute at a professional level to companies, educational and research institutions, and other leading organisations. The content and structure of each course is described in detail on the departmental website (see Course StructureLink opens in a new window section) which also contains further information on many of the topics included in this handbook.

The purpose of this handbook is twofold:

i. to provide new students with a convenient guide to the organisation and administration of degree courses in the Department of Computer Science; and

ii. to provide existing students with essential reference information applicable to their studies.

If it contains anything inaccurate or misleading, or other information you believe should be included, please tell us.

This handbook contains rules and regulations concerning a number of topics. Many of these items, for example those relating to attendance, plagiarism, late submission penalties, coursework, and meetings with personal tutors, are very important. It will be assumed that you are familiar with them. Please read the handbook thoroughly, even if you are a returning student.

If you are unclear on any of the topics described in the Student Handbook, please discuss them with your Personal Tutor or your Director of Studies. If in doubt, please ask. We are sure that you will find studying in the Department of Computer Science interesting, challenging and rewarding. We wish you every success and look forward to working with you.
