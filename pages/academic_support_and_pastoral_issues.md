Personal Tutors 
The University’s Personal Tutor system is the foundation of its student support and welfare provision. A member of the academic staff will be assigned as your Personal Tutor, normally for the whole of your time at Warwick. Your Personal Tutor is available to provide general academic advice and to discuss personal matters which are affecting you and your studies. They will represent your interests at examination boards, so if there is ever any circumstance, such as illness or unusual stress, which might affect your work it is essential that you let your Personal Tutor know as soon as possible. Even when things are going well, it is important that you maintain contact with your Personal Tutor and discuss matters such as option choices with them. Your Personal Tutor will monitor your general academic progress and will also be the person who provides references and recommendations for you when the time comes. 

All students should meet with their Personal Tutor in the first week of each term, and a meeting slot should be timetabled. If for any reason you cannot meet with your Personal Tutor at that time, please make contact as soon as possible and certainly within the first week of term. These meetings must take place in person.  

These tutor meetings constitute formal ‘monitoring points’ within the University as described in the section on Attendance . In order to keep track of this initial termly contact and to identify students who may need further support, the department uses the Tabula online system to monitor meetings. During or immediately after each meeting either you or your Personal Tutor must fill in a form on Tabula, and you/they will subsequently receive an email asking you or them to log on to Tabula to view the record and confirm that it is correct. It is likely that you will be in contact with your Personal Tutor more than once a term, but this recorded meeting will act as the first point of contact. The record of the meeting must be made in the same week as the meeting occurs to ensure that you are recorded as having met the monitoring point. 

It is a Departmental requirement that you see your tutor at the start of each term and that the meeting is recorded. If you receive an email requesting you to confirm the record of a meeting with your personal tutor you must respond – if you do not, the meeting will remain unrecorded as if it had not taken place. 

If you need to see your tutor in person at any time, try to contact them during their Office Hours. A list of staff office hours is available online. These are specific times each week when your tutor will be available without appointment. If you need to see your tutor more urgently, you should make contact and set up an online meeting (staff are normally expected to respond to emails within 2 working days). The current email addresses of all staff are available online.

There may also be times when your tutor needs to contact you. Again, the easiest way is by email and you must check your University email daily. Please respond promptly when your tutor requests a reply or a meeting. 

University education differs from school education and many students find that it takes time to adapt to the different modes of study. Questions specific to a particular module should generally be addressed to the module organiser or seminar tutor. Do not hesitate to seek help as soon as you feel you have difficulties with modules or coursework. For more general problems, you should contact your Personal Tutor in the first instance. If necessary, your Personal Tutor will refer you to the most appropriate source of further help. In addition, the Department Senior Tutors, University Wellbeing Support Services, the Faculty Senior Tutor and the University Dean of Students are available to provide further support and consultation (see below). 

Department Senior Tutors 
The Department has two Senior Tutors who help ensure the smooth running of the Personal Tutor system. The Senior Tutors can provide support, for example by acting as a back-up tutor if another member of staff is away. The current Senior Tutors are indicated in the Staff Responsibilities section of this booklet. To contact a senior tutor, please use the email seniortutordcs@warwick.ac.uk 

Wellbeing Support Services 
There is a comprehensive network of support services available to students in times of difficulty. This includes a wide range of support accessed online.

Faculty Senior Tutor and the University Dean of Students 
Wellbeing Support Services and the University Dean of Students work closely together to help students in times of need. If a student needs help or advice during their time at Warwick, it is likely that one of them will be able to help.

Sometimes a Personal Tutor may refer a tutee on to Wellbeing Support Services or the University Dean of Students. Students are welcome to make contact directly.

References 
Students requiring a reference for a job or for further study should ask their Personal Tutor in the first instance (and it is very helpful to provide their Personal Tutor with an up to date CV). If two references are required the second would usually be supplied by the student's project supervisor in the third or fourth year of study. In the unlikely event that either of these academics is unavailable, students should seek advice from the Department Senior Tutors (email seniortutordcs@warwick.ac.uk).
