Contact Details
You must ensure that the University has an up to date contact details (including address, phone number, and next-of-kin). These can be updated online.

Access to Computer Science
The Department has a tradition of ensuring 24-hour access for all students to the computers in the Computer Science building. External doors to the building are locked and alarmed. Access is via the front door of the building, which is fitted with a card reader system. Outside office hours students are restricted to the Student Common Rooms and the laboratories on the ground floor.

If you are in the building out of office hours you must be in possession of a University Card. There are checks by Security patrols and students without this form of identification, or who are in restricted areas, will be asked to leave. These rules are for your safety and the protection of University property. A failure to cooperate can result in the withdrawal of access.

Mobile Telephones
Telephones must be put on silent or switched off in all lectures, laboratory classes, seminars and tutorials.

E-mail
The Department will use your @warwick.ac.uk email address for all correspondence. Please read this daily.

Additional Costs
As well as tuition fees and living expenses, there are likely to be some extra things you will pay for whilst studying for your degree. Some of these will be optional, e.g. a book you wish to buy that isn’t on a reading list, and some will be compulsory, e.g. a pre-sessional English Language courses if your English language test results requires this.

The Department provides well-equipped laboratories with 24-hour access (normally) to enable the completion of coursework assignments. Students are not required to purchase a computer, however many choose to do so. If you wish to buy a computer, recommended specifications are provided here https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/dcs/teaching/recommended_it/.

Essential reading is published via Talis AspireLink opens in a new window and textbooks are available online or from the Library.

Where applicable, information about additional costs are given on the “Study” tab of individual module pages (https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/dcs/teaching/modules/).

Please also check the individual module pages for cost associated with modules taken outside the Department.

Student Staff Liaison Committee
This is the official forum for discussion between students and staff in the Department and it meets at least once a term. It consists of two elected student representatives for each year of the undergraduate course, and staff representatives. The SSLC is a very effective body in which views can be exchanged, suggestions made for improvements and complaints discussed. Matters raised at SSLC meetings are considered at the next CS Staff Meeting, at which a student SSLC member is a permanent invitee.

Election of the SSLC representatives takes place early in Term 1 and it is important that all students participate and vote in the election.

SSLCs are led by the Student Union, which maintains lists of representatives and minutes of meetings. The Department keeps a copy of this information for Undergraduate and MSc SSLCs.

Questionnaires and Student Feedback
The University and the Department place great importance on maintaining teaching of the highest quality. To help achieve this, towards the end of each module you are asked to complete an anonymous questionnaire, which provides information on the quality of provision. The replies play a key part in enhancing quality and therefore it is important that questionnaires are completed and submitted promptly as requested.

In addition to module questionnaires, you will be asked for your views via other surveys, such as the National Student Survey (NSS) and the International Student Barometer (ISB). You are strongly encouraged to complete all surveys that relate to your course of study so that the results accurately reflect the views of the majority of students, and that the Department can take appropriate action to correct any deficiencies.

Official University Publications
The University Calendar contains the ordinances and regulations on all University matters.

Regulations that relate to undergraduate studies include:

Regulations for first degrees (regulation 8)

Note: We make every effort to ensure that the information contained in this handbook is accurate and up to date. However, the final arbiter of University policy is the official University regulations as laid down in the Calendar.

Student Complaints and Feedback
If you have any complaints, worries or suggestions about teaching, you should let the department know. You can do this in the first instance by informing any one of:

The staff member responsible for the activity in question. This would be the lecturer (Module Organiser) in the case of taught modules.
Your Personal Tutor.
Your Staff Student Liaison Committee (SSLC) representatives.
The Director of Studies.
If you have a more serious worry or are not satisfied with the response you get, you should contact the head of department either in person or in writing.

The Department takes all complaints and suggestions seriously. We will respond to all points raised either by changing our practices or by explaining why this is not possible. There are both informal and formal channels for making a complaint or providing feedback about a department or service at the University of Warwick. The University encourages informal resolution where appropriate and also has a formal Student Academic Complaints Procedure. Full details of the various channels are detailed on the Complaints page of the University website, along with information about the Office of the Independent Adjudicator and support open to students across the University.

Academic Appeals
Under certain defined circumstances and as per the University Calendar (University Regulations) students may appeal against decisions relating to their academic progress or outcomes. These may be summarised broadly as follows:

Final-year undergraduate students may appeal against the award of a particular degree class or if they have not been awarded a qualification.

First year and intermediate-year undergraduate students have the right to appeal only against a decision that they be required to withdraw from their course of study, and then only if they are in possession of relevant evidence which was not available to the Board of Examiners when its decision was reached.

Further information and details of the appeals process can be found in the University Calendar (see also Regulations 8, 37.5 and 38.9).

Dignity at Work
It is University policy to treat all staff and students fairly and with dignity and respect (see the web page on Equality, Diversity and Inclusion), and as a Department we take this responsibility very seriously. We operate a zero tolerance policy to bullying and harassment of any kind.

If you are the victim of any sort of bullying, harassment or discrimination, then please report it. The following staff may be approached in the first instance:

The Department Senior Tutors (Mike Joy and Rossella Suma)
