The Department of Computer Science provides a Linux environment for teaching and project work. This environment allows students a great deal of freedom in what software systems they create and use, and this freedom carries with it a high degree of responsibility to ensure that equipment is not misused, and the University expects all students to exercise this care.

University regulations
The regulations governing the use of University computing facilities are published on the IT Services web pages, and you should acquaint yourself with these. It is emphasised in these regulations that access to computing equipment is provided only for a student’s individual use and for a specified purpose.

Particular attention must be drawn to what is called hacking, a loose term which denotes anything from the mischievous and inquisitive to malicious anti-social behaviour that can destroy or infect whole systems. Any attempted or actual breach of the security of a system is a major offence under the University’s Disciplinary Regulations. Where necessary, the University Disciplinary Committee will not hesitate to fine, and formally reprimand students for the misuse of computer facilities.

The Department is bound by these regulations and will deal with any such offences in the prescribed manner. Note that many of these offences are also covered under the Computer Misuse Act 1990 and may therefore attract criminal prosecution.

The facilities must not be used to propagate material of a racist, sexist or generally offensive nature. In particular storage of pornographic or sexist material on the system is an offence and will be dealt with severely. Care must be taken at all times not to compromise system security, which can lead to abuse by outside parties.

Help and advice
Information about using the Department's computing systems can be found in the user guide. Please consult this guide before requesting help by other means, simply asking other students is a good interactive way of resolving issues. The user guide explains how to use the man manual command. Help queries can be emailed to unixhelp@dcs.warwick.ac.uk or made in person at rooms CS1.12, CS1.16 & CS1.18.

Particular attention should be paid to the following points:

Have you been hacked?
Watch out for any unexpected changes in the way your account behaves that are not experienced by other users, it may indicate unauthorised access to your account. Report any serious suspicions as above.

Do not leave yourself logged-on, the most likely reason for unauthorised access. Your best defence is to use a strong password. User accounts are attacked by hacking programs that will try to guess your password. They try dictionary words, common names and simple variations such as adding a digit or changing letters for digits. You should use a wide alphabet of upper and lower case letters, digits and special characters to construct an obscure non-guessable password. You should enable two factor authentication on your account, so you can access the DCS Linux systems remotely.

Please report all equipment faults by email to tech@dcs.warwick.ac.uk.

Terminal Rooms
Rooms CS0.01, CS0.03, CS0.06 and MB0.01, MB3.17 are designated as work areas under the University Regulations and the consumption of food and drink are forbidden in these rooms. The restrictions do not apply to the Student Common Rooms CS0.02 and CS0.07

Printers
There are networked laser printers available for undergraduate students. All students are given a number of free printer credits, when these are exhausted extra credits may be obtained if there is a reasonable need. Please contact unixhelp@dcs.warwick.ac.uk with any requests for further credits, including the number of credits requested and the reasons for needing more printing credits than initially allocated. This system is separate from IT Services printer credits and credits are not transferable between the two systems.
