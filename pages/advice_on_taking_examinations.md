All examinations organised by the Department of Computer Science are in-person and held on campus (these are “CS” coded examinations). Students must be physically present on campus to undertake their in-person assessments and reassessments. Failure to attend an in-person examination due to misreading of an examination timetable is not a valid mitigating circumstance. 

A large part of your evaluation will be by formal examinations, which are conducted by the Academic Office. There are several steps you can take to improve your marks in the exams and therefore obtain a degree classification that reflects your abilities.

The University publishes guidance for on-campus examinations.

Revision
Several weeks of the third term are scheduled for revision. Plan your revision for each module and use this time wisely. Use past examination papers as part of the revision process: the more practice you have at answering typical questions, the more prepared you will be. The University maintains a Past Papers Archive.

Do attend scheduled revision classes, which are arranged for your benefit. There will be a minimum of 1 or 2 revision classes for each CS module examined during the summer, depending on whether the module is weighted at 6/7.5 or 12/15 credits. You will gain more from revision classes if you prepare before-hand; their goal is only to help you revise material that should already be well understood. Revision sessions will be added to your timetable at the end of Term 2 and these will be displayed through Tabula.

Wellbeing Support Services have a number of resources to help with managing exam stress.

Before the exam period
Make sure you are well-rested and calm for each exam. Make up your schedule for the exams, noting the exact time an exam will start. You are only allowed to be late by up to half hour for an exam, after that you will be denied access to the exam. Students have been known to arrive in the afternoon for a morning exam, or to arrive at 4pm for an exam scheduled for '14:00', resulting in a mandatory mark of 0.

Spend some time before starting exams to make sure your handwriting is legible. In these days of keyboard use many people do not get enough practice writing on paper, but for exams it is invaluable that examiners can easily read what you have written, as you will not gain marks for answers that are illegible. Thus try to show your handwriting to colleagues and make an effort to practice writing speedily but legibly.

Make sure you have appropriate stationery. Writing with a blue or black pen instead of a pencil makes your script more legible. If you are prone to making corrections, erasable pens or tippex may be a good option. Try using different colours to help clarify your text (particularly for calculations and figures), but do not use red ink. Clarify with the examiners beforehand if calculators are allowed for each exam, and make sure any calculator you plan to use satisfies the departmental regulations.

You are required to bring your Student ID Card to the exam

Starting an exam
We strongly advise against students bringing bags, cases or backpacks to on-campus examinations as there are limited and unsecured facilities for the storage of bags across examination venues. The University Examination RegulationsLink opens in a new window should be carefully checked beforehand as they will explain the arrangements for arriving at the exam venue, and they must be followed.

Students are permitted to bring smart devices into the examination venue. However, all smart devices must be switched off, stored in the plastic bag provided, which will be sealed and placed under your chair. Items must not be removed from the bag until the examination script has been collected

It is advisable to answer exactly the number of questions that you have been instructed to, if there is a choice between questions. Any extra answers must be crossed out and the examiner is not under any obligation to mark any additional answers given.

You are strongly advised to start each question on a new page. This will give you space to make changes and improvements to the question easily later on. Make sure to write clearly the number of the question or part thereof that you are answering, either clearly in the margin or on a line of its own. If you need to do some rough work before writing an answer, to do it at the end of the answer book.

Composing answers
Give clear concise answers, and follow the spirit of the question: if you are asked for a definition, do not just produce an example. Read carefully for keywords such as explain, define, illustrate, etc. In your answer, address only that which is asked for - if you are asked to explain a specific point then do just that. You will not gain extra marks for writing everything you know about the topic, you only lose valuable time.

Exams are both about assessing what you know, and about how well you can explain what you know. Use correct grammar and attempt proper composition. It is often acceptable to provide answers in note form (such as with bullet-points), rather than writing a long essay. This is easier for you, and easier for the examiner to check that you have provided a correct and thorough answer. Sometimes diagrams can also improve an answer. For calculation-based questions, it is important to show your work in a clear and readable way.

Make sure to write clearly the number of the question or part thereof that you are answering, either clearly in the margin or on a line of its own. It is a good idea to start each question on a new page unless the rubric of the paper permits otherwise. If you think you need to do some rough work before writing an answer, try to do it at the end of the answer book.

Finishing an exam
Cross out any rough notes to ensure they do not get marked and thus do not have a negative effect on your performance. Enter the numbers of the questions that you have answered in the bottom section of the front cover of your answer book.

If you complete the examination with time to spare then read through your answers and attempt to improve them - this is almost always possible. While it may seem like a waste of time to stay in the examination room, students who leave early throw away marks: examiners confirm that students who stay until the end of the examination do better than those who leave early. So always use all the time available to you productively and do not leave the examination room before the end of the allocated time.

You will be asked to remain seated until your script has been collected by an invigilator. Please wait quietly and leave quietly when instructed to do so.

The full set of University Examination Regulations are set out in Regulation 10 (Section 2 of the University Calendar).
