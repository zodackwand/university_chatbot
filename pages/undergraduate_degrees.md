Degree courses in the Department of Computer Science aim to equip students to be successful professionals in the rapidly changing world of technology. The broad objective is to provide students with wide-ranging practical skills for the effective use of computers and sufficient knowledge of the theoretical foundations for them to understand and participate in future developments.

BSc Degrees in Computer Science
The single honours Computer Science and joint honours Computer Science and Business Studies courses share a common first year which covers the programming skills, mathematics, and essential organisation of computer systems, together with the professional skills required of an information engineer. The single honours BSc degrees are of three-year duration. There is a 4-year (MEng) variant of the Computer Science degree. Please see below for details on the BCS accreditation of all our courses.

Joint Degrees - DM, CSE, CSBS, DS
BEng/BSc Computer Systems Engineering is taught jointly by the Department of Computer Science and the School of Engineering. Students take core and optional modules from each department and pursue a Computer Systems Engineering project in the final year. This is an integrated joint honours, that is, you will study a combination of both computing and engineering in each year of the degree.

For students who wish to graduate with a BSc award rather than a BEng, the deadline to request this is before the start of term 3 in your final year of study by emailing dcs.ug.support@warwick.ac.uk - please note that this decision cannot be amended once confirmed. There is a 4-year (MEng) variant of the Computer Systems Engineering degree.

BSc Discrete Mathematics is taught jointly by the Department of Computer Science, the Warwick Mathematics Institute and Department of Statistics. Students take core and optional modules from each department and pursue a discrete mathematics project in the third year. Again, this is an integrated degree with modules covering both mathematics and computing offered in all years of study. There is a 4-year (MEng) variant of the Discrete Mathematics degree.

Our joint BSc degree with the Warwick Business School, Computer Science with Business Studies (CSBS), differs from our other joint degrees in that it is an end-on course. Students on the CSBS degree course follow the first two years of the Computer Science syllabus. Subject to satisfactory overall performance in their first two years, to include at least a second-class result in an IB-coded module, they then proceed to a third year comprising selected modules in Business Studies.

The BSc Data Science degree course is administered by the Statistics Department and taught jointly with the Department of Computer Science. Students take core and optional modules from each department and pursue a data science project in the third year.

MEng Degrees
Four-year degree courses leading to an MEng in Computer Science, MEng in Computer Systems Engineering or MEng in Discrete Mathematics are available to suitably qualified students.

Students on an MEng course follow the respective BSc/BEng course in their first year. Performance at 2(i) honours level or above (60% for CS, CSE and 65% for DM see Variation to Rules for Award for Discrete Mathematics MEng) in the second year is a prerequisite for progression to the third year of the MEng. To progress from Year 3 to Year 4 DM students must achieve an average of 55%.

In their third year, CS and CSE students on the MEng follow a variant of the third-year BSc/BEng course in which the core is supplemented by a project management module, thus making the third year of the MEng distinct. In the fourth year of CS and CSE students will be required to undertake a group project.

BSc, BEng, or MEng Degrees with Intercalated Year
Students who organise a suitable industrial placement can transfer to a variant of the BSc, BEng or MEng that includes an intercalated year. This enables students to gain industrial and commercial skills and experience. It also means that the contribution of their year in industry is reflected in the title of their degree. As an alternative to an industrial placement, it may be possible to study overseas, e.g., at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. The Intercalated Year Co-ordinator will be able to give further details.

The academic curriculum and assessment procedures for the BSc, BEng or MEng with Intercalated Year are identical to those of the BSc, BEng, or MEng courses. To obtain recognition for the intercalated year in their degree title, a student must submit a satisfactory written report at the end of the intercalated year. Students studying overseas must pass enough modules at the overseas institution.

Details of the Intercalated Year degree variants are given on the Departmental web site. Applications must be made at an early stage and any queries should be addressed to the Intercalated Year Co-ordinator. Students on a visa under the Student Route (previously known as Tier 4 Student Visa) may be subject to additional conditions to be able to transfer.

BCS Accreditation
The following courses have received Full CITP accreditation by BCS (The Chartered Institute for IT) for 2023-2027 intakes:

- BSc (Hons) Computer Science

- MEng Computer Science

- BSc/BEng (Hons) Computer Systems Engineering

- MEng Computer Systems Engineering

The same applies to the 'With Intercalated Year' option of all these courses. More details on accreditation can be found on this page.

Transferring between Courses
Course transfers and course restarts are requested through eVision.

All matters concerning transfers, either to courses with Intercalated Year, MEng, or to other degree courses at Warwick, should be discussed with your personal tutor first and the Director of Undergraduate Studies.

Transfers from Computer Systems Engineering to Computer Science, Discrete Mathematics or Data Science are not permitted.

It may be possible to transfer between Computer Science, Discrete Mathematics and Data Science. The deadline to do this is the end of week 2, term 1 in your first year. Students would need to have been made an offer, and met the offer, for the degree they are looking to transfer to. During your first year, you may still switch by course restart. The deadline to request this is 29 January 2025 (the date that course applications via UCAS close).

Students can transfer from Computer Science to Computer Science with Business Studies up to the end of Year 2 provided the student has met the requirements for transfer.

Students wishing to transfer from the BEng/BSc to MEng can make this request up to the 31st of January in their second year. Requests received after this will not be considered until after the end of year results are known. Requests made in Year 3 will be rejected if the incorrect student module selection has been made e.g., Third year BSc Computer Science must have chosen CS352 (core for MEng) in term 1 to transfer.

Students wishing to transfer from the MEng to BEng/BSc should make the request before the end of Term 2 in their second year. However, if a student becomes a finalist by dropping down to the BEng/BSc, requests will continue to be processed until Board of Examiner meetings.

Requests to transfer to an intercalated year will not be actioned until after the end of Term 3.

Students entering on a BSc/BEng course and who are not currently on a visa under the Student Route (previously known as Tier 4 Student Visa), may transfer to the respective MEng course at any time during their first year of study. Students will need to attain the prerequisite performance and receive permission from the Director of Undergraduate Study. Students on a visa under the Student Route who wish to transfer from BSc/BEng to the respective MEng course or vice versa, (or onto a non-related course in another department), may not be able to do so without leaving the country and applying for fresh entry clearance from overseas. Further information on course change and transfers for international students may be found on the International Office's web site.
