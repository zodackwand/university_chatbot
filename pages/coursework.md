Submission of Coursework for Assessment
The vast majority of Department of Computer Science coursework assignments are submitted via Tabula.

Up to the deadline date and time (12 noon), you can submit a piece of coursework to Tabula multiple times. Only the latest submission of your work will be accepted and, once the deadline has passed, you will not be able to change it.

-For modules in the School of Engineering, guidance on coursework submission and information about assignment deadlines can be found on the relevant Coursework and Submission webpages.

-For Warwick Business School (WBS) modules, coursework should be submitted electronically via my.wbs by 7pm on the submission date.

While attempts are made to avoid deadline clashes by communicating deadlines to other departments, students on the CSE, DM and CSBS degree courses should recognise that deadline clashes are sometimes unavoidable. Students are responsible for managing their time effectively so that all assignments are submitted on time.

It is recommended that students submit coursework in advance of the deadlines to allow themselves the opportunity to ensure that they have uploaded the correct file/s.

Uploading an incorrect file is not grounds for Mitigating Circumstances.

Where students realise after the deadline that an incorrect file has been uploaded, and they are able to resubmit within the time permitted by the Module Organiser for late submission, they may do so but will incur a late penalty. If students are unable to resubmit via Tabula, they should contact dcs.ug.support@warwick.ac.uk to have the original submission removed so that they are able to upload a new submission. This will incur a late penalty. Late penalties will not be waived unless via a Mitigating Circumstances panel decision.

 

Late Submission of Coursework
Late submission of coursework will be subject to a deduction from the marks awarded of five percentage points for every working day or part thereof that it is late, unless a formal extension to the submission deadline has been granted. For example, an assignment marked as 65% and submitted two working days late would receive a ten percent deduction, giving a final mark for the piece of work of 55%. For small pieces of work (less than 2 CATS) more stringent rules may apply, e.g. late submission may not be permitted and a zero mark applied. In some circumstances a student may be required to submit additional coursework or sit an additional examination.

In the rare cases when work must be submitted both electronically and in hardcopy, it is the time of the electronic submission that will used to determine the time of submission.

 

Extensions to Submission Deadlines
Some assessments are eligible for self-certified extensions. To apply for a self-certified extension, complete the self-certification form, available from the "Personal circumstances" tab on Tabula.

An extension to a submission deadline can also be granted in the case of serious medical problems or on compassionate grounds.

-Department of Computer Science extension requests must be completed through the online form on Tabula. A medical note or other documentary evidence must be attached, and the application should be made either before the published deadline or as soon as practicably possible.

-For modules taken in other departments, the extension request procedure may vary. If there is no option to request the extension on the module page on Tabula, please use the ‘Declare mitigating circumstances’ tab in “Personal Circumstances” in Tabula (as if you were declaring for the more serious mitigating circumstances) to make the request.

Please see the Mitigating Circumstances section of in the Student Handbook for more information on self-certification and extension requests

Rules for submission of assessed work and extensions are detailed in Section F of Examination and Degree Conventions.

 

Return of Provisional Marks and Feedback
We aim to notify you of your provisional mark with feedback within 20 working days of the assignment submission date. If you are unable to submit an assignment by the published hand-in date and are granted an extension, this may delay marking and any associated feedback. If many extensions have been given, this will delay the marking and moderation process and therefore any associated feedback for the full cohort.

The deadlines for coursework are shown in the calendars on the deadlines pages of the departmental website.

Please note that we retain a copy of each of your assignments so that they are available to the board of internal and external examiners that make final decisions on degree awards. We will not normally return copies of assessed work to you. which means that you should keep a copy for future reference.

Cheating and Plagiarism
The University has regulations defining and proscribing forms of cheating in examinations and assessed work. You are expected to be aware of these regulations and abide by them - they are published on the University’s Governance webpages.

Extract from warwick.ac.uk/services/gov/calendar/section2/regulations/academic_integrity/:

“... ‘cheating’ means an attempt to benefit oneself or another, by deceit or fraud. This shall include reproducing one's own work or the work of another person or persons without proper acknowledgement. "

The work of others may be quoted if an acknowledgement is made. This should be a properly stated reference to the author, work, date and page number. The quoted part should be clearly indicated, for example by quotation marks or indentation. An overview of referencing styles commonly used at the University is available at warwick.ac.uk/services/library/students/referencing/referencing-styles/

Reproducing the work of others without acknowledgement, whether in an essay, a program, a report or another form of academic output, will be viewed as serious contravention of University Regulations. The procedure followed where cheating is suspected is laid down in Reg. 11 Academic Integrity.

Coursework assignments are subject to automated checks that detect possible instances of plagiarism. These checks include comparisons with source materials on the internet and assignments from previous years across the UK.

You must not purchase essays, programs or other pieces of work in order to submit all or part of these as your own work. This is a form of cheating just as much as any other.

In each of the last few years, students have been penalised for submitting the work of another for assessment, and for providing the work that was submitted. Discussion of general concepts and ideas is a healthy academic activity. However, any work submitted for assessment must not include that of others. The penalties can be severe. For example, collaboration in writing a program or including a section of text from elsewhere without observing proper academic attribution conduct, can result in a mark of zero for the assignment or for the entire module.

You are strongly advised to read the University’s advice on Academic Integrity.

Generative AI tools (GAITs)
Generative AI tools (GAITs), such as ChatGPT or Google Gemini, use Large Language Models (LLMs), neural networks and deep learning to extract patterns in data. This means that they can very easily produce various types of content including text, images and source code.

These tools are likely to have a profound impact on the way in which educators teach, the way students learn, and how students’ learning is assessed. However, it is important to know that, like all AI tools, GAITs have their limitations and biases, and care should be taken in their use.

The following is the current departmental policy towards the use of GAITs in assessed work and should be adhered to by students. These guidelines have been adapted from the guidance developed by the WIHEA Artificial Intelligence in Education working group. For the full guidance see https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/cross_fac/academy/activities/learningcircles/future-of-learning/

What can you use GAITs for?
Generative AI tools (GAITs) can assist you in demonstrating your own criticality and drawing comparisons. They can also provide information that will help you to engage with the literature and sources.

They can assist with:

-Lateral thinking;

-Alternative thought streams;

-Supplementary and complementary thinking;

-Data, charts, and images, generic code structure;

-Getting starter explanations; a note of caution that you must fact check this information;

-Creating novel insights through repeated interrogation;

-For formative learning; and

-Rewriting your work or translation within the guidelines of the Proofreading policy (warwick.ac.uk/services/aro/dar/quality/categories/examinations/policies/v_proofreading/ ).

You can also use these tools to enhance your learning, for example:

-As a revision tool to generate practice questions

-Structuring plans and lines of reasoning

-Supporting language skills

Where you have used GAITs more broadly, this should be clearly acknowledged using, for example, one of the following four disclaimers.

1.[GAIT Name] has assisted in structuring this assessment. This was used to help me organise my thoughts, the underlying work remains my own. I provide specifics in the document/source code.

2.[GAIT Name] was used to generate alternative streams of thought. It was used to generate ideas to help me start my assessment. I have attributed the ideas it generated and my further development of them remains my own. I provide specifics in the document/source code.

3.[GAIT NAME] has been used to proofread, edit, and refine spelling and grammar in the following sections. This was used because I am not confident in the use of English tenses. I provide specifics in the document/source code.

4.In specific cases where code or text has been generated by GAITs, please cite those instances as “personal communication with [GAIT NAME]” (because it is based on asking a question or giving a prompt and receiving an answer). This is usually an in-text only citation.

You should also keep a complete copy of the chat protocol and any material generated for you in case it is requested by a marker.

What should you not use GAITs for?
-Replacing learning.

-Gaining an unfair advantage. This is academic misconduct.

-Creating content for your work which you present as your own work. This is plagiarism. This includes source code.

-Synthesising information. You will not be able to demonstrate your work and thinking as opposed to that artificially generated.

Examples of GAIT misuse include, but are not limited to, the following:

-Copying or paraphrasing sections of AI-Generative content so that the work is not yours, but you present it as yours;

-Copying or paraphrasing whole responses of AI-Generative content without correct attribution and explanation;

-Using an AI to complete parts of the assessment so that the work does not reflect your own work, analysis, evaluation, or calculations;

-Failing to acknowledge use of AI tools when they have been used as a source of information;

-Incomplete or poor acknowledgement of AI tools; or

-Submitting work with intentionally incomplete or misleading references or bibliographies.

You should also ensure you have read and understood Warwick’s Academic Integrity Framework (warwick.ac.uk/services/aro/dar/quality/az/acintegrity/framework/).

These guidelines will apply unless module organisers provide alternative guidance.

You may be required to attend an in-person viva to demonstrate ownership of content you claim as your own.

Software Repositories
It is becoming increasingly common for students to use repositories (such as GitHub and GitLab) to store and manage their coursework. If you do this, you must make sure that your repositories are marked as "private" (and remain so, even after you have left the University), since by default they may be public and may be seen by other students. If you make your coursework public, and it is viewed or copied by other students, you may be investigated for abetting plagiarism (just as if you had deliberately handed your work to another student to copy).

If you need to make a "portfolio" visible to potential employers, then the above still holds - either give the employer individual access (if the repository allows it), or make sure no source code is included.
