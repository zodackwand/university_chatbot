Introduction
Working with a PC and sitting in a badly designed chair with poor posture, can lead over a period of time to disorders that can affect the hands, fingers, wrists, elbows, arms, shoulders and neck.

RSI (repetitive strain injury) is defined as discomfort, impairment, disability or persistent pains in the human body’s joints, muscles, tendons, etc. For computer users RSI most frequently occurs in the soft tissue of the hands, arms, shoulders and the neck. In addition, incorrect workstation and chair design or adjustment, together with other factors can lead to back pain, stress, eye fatigue and headaches.

Am I at risk?
Only a small proportion of people using PCs suffer health problems, but because there are so many users this can be a significant number overall. Where problems do occur, they are generally caused by the way in which Display Screen Equipment (DSE) is being used, rather than the DSE itself. Problems can be avoided by good workplace and job design and by the way you use your DSE.

Using a workstation effectively
Correct Posture
Sit up straight in front of your keyboard and screen
Do not sit with feet or legs crossed. Your feet should be flat on the ground and there should be enough space under the desk/table to move your legs freely.
Lower arms and thighs should be parallel to the ground. If possible make adjustments to your chair.
Using the Keyboard
Make sure that the keyboard is tilted.
Your wrists and fingers should line up directly with your lower arms and not be bent as you type.
Do not hammer at the keyboard when typing and do not over stretch your fingers.
Using the Mouse
Keep your mouse within easy reach. Wrists should not be leaning on anything nor leaning to the side.
Flex your hands and fingers to prevent cramp and aches.
Take frequent short pauses and take your hand off the mouse and let your mouse arm hang straight down from your shoulder.
Use alternative keyboard actions so that you are not continually using the mouse.
Try changing your mouse from right to left-handed use (or vice versa) from time to time.
Avoiding eye and neck strain
Avoid long spells of work, which can lead to tired eyes and discomfort.
Adjust your screen angle to avoid reflections and use the blinds/curtains at the windows.
If you notice an eyesight problem after viewing the screen, have your eyes checked. You may need a pair of glasses for working on your computer.
Adjust the screen angle to prevent straining your neck. If you continually strain your neck you will develop discomfort in your shoulders and back.
Take a break
We recommend that no work session should be longer than 90 minutes without a break or change of activity of at least 15 minutes.
If you have any aches and pains, these should be investigated, and the length of the work session should be reduced to 30 minutes followed by a 5-minute break.
Using laptops and other portable computers
Do not use for long periods.
Make sure that you have the keyboard on a firm surface.
Make sure that the computer is at the right height for keying in and viewing the screen.
Consider buying additional equipment to aid usability e.g. screen, mouse, keyboard, stand.
Problems
If you get aches, pains, tingling fingers or headaches you should see your doctor.
If you are experiencing problems with your eyes you should have your eyes checked.
