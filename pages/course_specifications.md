Course Specifications
Each Academic Department at Warwick is responsible for maintaining Course Specifications on their own website. The Course Specification must provide the following information: the list of Core and Optional modules by year of study; the required number of credits at each level of study and; the relative credit weightings across the years for the final degree classification.
The sets of modules for each programme of study, both core and options, in each year, which comply with the Course Specification are listed in Course Structure. The credit weightings across the years are given in the Assessment section of the Student Handbook.

Core and Optional Modules
In each year of their course, students are expected to study a core group of modules and to make up the required normal load for the year by choosing a set of optional modules. There is a choice of optional modules available and there may be requirements to be satisfied by the choices: that a minimum number be chosen from a specific list. Module credits are computed in terms of CATS credits.
-Undergraduate students may choose to take modules adding up to more than the normal 120 CATS load.
-The total credit for the year must not exceed 150 CATS.
-First year students should not normally take more than 120 CATS.
-MSc students must take 180 CATS.
Most modules in the Department of Computer Science have a credit value of 15 CATS credits. Note that other departments may have different CATS credits schemes, so the credit for an option chosen from those offered by another department may not follow this norm.
The normal load of 120 CATS credits relates to an undergraduate study year of 30 weeks x 40 hours. Hence 1 CATS credit is equivalent to 10 hours of study; 15 CATS = 150 hours. This time includes timetabled classes, private study, revision, assignment completion, and formal examinations.
Options
Options are technically divided into ‘usual’ and ‘unusual’ options. Note that MSc students are not permitted to take 'unusual' options.
Usual Options
Usual options are those modules listed in the Course Regulations for your degree. Usual options are offered in lists labelled A, B, etc. List A ‘usual’ options are timetabled so that they generally do not clash with core modules or other 'usual' options. An updated list of usual optional modules is provided in the Course Specification.
Unusual Options - Undergraduate Students
‘Unusual’ options are modules offered by other departments not listed in the Course Specification for your degree. Undergraduate students may take up to 30 CATS credits of unusual options per academic year. In theory it is possible to take any module offered by any other Department as an ‘unusual’ option, provided any prerequisites have been met and the respective Module Organiser(s) agrees. You may wish to investigate modules in areas of personal interest. In practice, the wide choice of options is limited by:
-modules having prerequisites,
-timetable clashes, and
-university assessment conventions.
Students should note that many modules run for a full year rather than a single term. Thus, it is important to check for potential timetable clashes in all terms. It is also important to check that the Course Regulations are complied with. It is a good idea to discuss possible options with your Personal Tutor and/or Course Director at an early stage. If you do take an unusual option, you must complete an unusual option form. Unusual options can only be taken with the approval of the Module Organiser(s), the support of your Personal Tutor and the approval of the Director of Undergraduate Studies (obtained when the through the submission of an unusual option form).
Restrictions
There may be some restrictions on specific modules:
-Students cannot take unusual options where there is an overlap in content. For example, PH136, PX281 and PX390 may not be taken in any year of a CS-based degree. This is checked on a case-by-case basis.
-1st and 2nd year students in the Department of Computer Science are not permitted to take modules from a different year of study.
-CS9** coded modules are not accessible to undergraduate students.
-It may be possible for 3rd year students to take 4th year modules, but this will be assessed on a case-by-case basis e.g., it will help with the 3rd year project. Students should aware that the pass mark for FHEQ (Framework for Higher Education Qualifications) Level 7 (Year 4) modules is 50% and that there is an increased risk they might not meet the requirements for award.
-Year 4 students will not generally be allowed to take Year 3 modules (exceptions include students for whom the option was not available in their 3rd year, or students who took their 3rd year at HKUST (Hong Kong University of Science and Technology)). Note that finalists on an integrated Masters course are required to take 120 CATS of FHEQ level 7 modules e.g., 4** coded.
-Students in the final year of a BSc, or the final or penultimate year of an MEng, are not able to take **2** modules due to the timing of the exam boards.
-IATL (Institute for Advanced Teaching and Learning) modules have a different coding convention, but the level should be appropriate. These modules do not allow for deregistration later.
- On the third year of the Discrete Mathematics course, certain modules cannot be taken if modules with the same content were taken in the second year. Full information about these restrictions can be found on the relevant course structures page, under “optional modules”.

Language Modules
The Language Centre supports the University's strategic priority of Internationalisation of the student experience and its commitment to expanding foreign language learning opportunities for undergraduate and postgraduate students across the University. For those interested in developing their language skills, the Language Centre offers a wide range of modules, resources, and programmes to support students. There are a few options available for acquiring a new foreign language or enhancing an existing language skill.
The Language Centre modules require you to sign up early for the modules. As such, it is important that you check the Language Centres guidance on module registration. Even if you take the module as a usual option, you must still register using the Language Centres module registration form first. More information on this can be found on the Language Centres enrolment page.
Note that you may only take one language module per academic year. In Years 1 & 2, you may take up to 15 CATS credits of language module using usual options, 30 CATS credit language modules will require students to use part of their unusual options allowance. In Years 3 & 4 all language modules will require the student to use some or all their unusual options allowance.
Plan ahead! Students in Year 3 & 4 are not permitted to take beginners level (level 1) language modules. The same modules as those available for academic credit are also available to take in addition to degree studies. A fee applies to these modules. More information is available from: http://warwick.ac.uk/languagecentre/academic/fees/ 
Module Registration – All Students
Core
All students will normally be registered automatically for their core modules.
Options
Students must register (by a process initiated by the University) for all modules they wish to be examined in. This can be done through eVision. Links to both eVision and a guide on how to use it can be found on the Modules Marks and Assessment Teams webpage on Module Registration. It may be possible to deregister from any chosen optional module at a later stage. However, if you fail to deregister for an optional module by the deadline set by the University, you will be assessed for this module even if you do not appear for the final examinations.
The deadlines for registration and deregistration are published by the Modules, Marks and Assessment Team and can be viewed here.
Students may not deregister from any module after more than 10% of the assessment for that module has been undertaken.
If you wish to deregister from a module provided by a department other than DCS, then you should check with the department concerned. Some departments may not permit deregistration once any assessment has taken place.
Registration for Warwick Business School (WBS) modules requires students to commit to modules early and register with both WBS (via myWBS) and DCS (via e:Vision).
Intermediate students wishing to register for a WBS module are advised to make their application to WBS in the previous academic year (usually April). While it may be possible to modify module registrations, late modification of WBS module registrations is only considered in exceptional circumstances, regardless of the University system. More information about WBS module availability can be found on the Computer Science with Business Studies webpage.
If you are an undergraduate student looking to take a Language Centre module as part of your degree, you need to follow the pre-enrolment procedure as detailed on the Language Centre website.
Registration by MSc Data Analytics students for modules from the Centre for Interdisciplinary Methodologies (coded as IM***) is more constrained. Places are limited on these modules and cannot be guaranteed. It is, therefore, important to register your interest for these modules with our PGT (postgraduate taught) support team (email dcs.pgt.support@warwick.ac.uk). Once you receive confirmation that you have been accepted onto the modules, you will not be allowed to deregister after this point. Please discuss taking any optional modules from CIM (Centre for Interdisciplinary Methodologies) with your Personal Tutor or the Director of PG Teaching.
