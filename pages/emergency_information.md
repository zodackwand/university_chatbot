Fire Safety

Information on Fire Safety can be found on the University's Health, Safety and Wellbeing website.

“Fire is potentially the greatest of all risks to personnel, business continuity and property. It can spread extremely quickly producing toxic, asphyxiating smoke. Fire hazards arise from structural features, the use to which the building is put, and the behaviour of people occupying and using the building.”


Whilst at the University you must familiarise yourself with the appropriate fire procedures

If you discover a fire

Shout "Fire" and operate the nearest red break glass point.

If you hear an alarm

If you hear the alarm in the building you are in evacuate immediately, calmly and safely.
Always leave by the nearest exit
Go to the assembly pointas directed (for the Computer Science building this is the concourse of the IMC, for the MSB building this is Car Park 15). Do not linger in doorways as this only impedes the fire brigade and endangers you and other people.
Never re-enter a building until you are told to do so by Community Safety, even if the alarms stop.
Never assume it's a false alarm! If the alarm sounds you must leave the building immediately.
Automatic fire detectors, warning systems and fire-fighting equipment are put in place for everybody's safety. To interfere with such systems and related equipment is irresponsible. It is a serious disciplinary matter and can result in the criminal prosecution of the individual. The fire detection system is extremely sensitive and can be easily activated through careless use of cooking facilities and aerosols. Blocking kitchen doors open is a primary cause of false alarms.
Fire doors onto staircases and kitchens protect your escape route and should never be blocked open
Emergency panel
Emergency Panels
In both Lab 0.01 and 0.06 near the entrance there are panel with an emergency button. Once pressed this should connect you to the community safety team. This is similar to an emergency call in a lift. Please remember that this is for emergency use only. These have been installed to reduce the risk and other possible issues that might occur with late night and lone working.

Please note: concerning late and lone working in the Computer Science building, it is safest to avoid working in the labs alone anytime outside of office hours (M-F, 8AM to 6PM) as there are fewer people around and very often no-one available in the building if you were to require help.
