Assessment conventions/Degree classification rules
For students starting bachelors or Integrated Masters Degrees from the 2021/22 academic year onward, decisions about progression from one stage of the course to the next, and decisions about the final award or classification are set out in the Rules for Award 2021-22 and Appendix A: Degree Classifications 2021-22. This details calculations used to determine your final classification and the minimum credit requirements by level of study for an award to be made.

For the award of a Bachelors degree a student must meet specific credit requirements achieving a minimum 270 credits (or CATS) across the degree course including a minimum of 90 credits at FHEQ level 6. Full details can be viewed in Appendix A of the Rules for Award here: Appendix A: Degree Appendix B 4 Classifications. The Course Specification details additional requirements with regard to required core modules and PSRB requirements that must be met in addition to this.

FHEQ Level 6 refers to modules taken in a student’s third year of study at Warwick coded CS3* (or ES3*, MA3*, ST3*)
For the award of an Integrated Masters degree a student must meet specific credit requirements achieving a minimum 360 credits (or CATS) across the degree course including a minimum of 90 credits at FHEQ level 7. Full details can be viewed in Appendix A of the Rules for Award: Appendix A: Degree Classifications. Course requirements detail additional requirements with regard to core modules and PSRB requirements that must be met in addition to this.

FHEQ Level 7 refers to modules taken in a student’s fourth year of study at Warwick coded CS4* (or ES4*, MA4*, ST4*)
For the award of a postgraduate taught Masters degree a student must meet specific credit requirements achieving a minimum 150 credits (or CATS) across the degree course at FHEQ Level 7. Full details can be viewed in Appendix A of the Rules for Award: Appendix A: Degree Classifications. Course requirements detail additional requirements with regard to core modules and PSRB requirements that must be met in addition to this.

FHEQ Level 7 refers to modules taken coded CS9* (or ES4*, ES9*, IM9*)
For students starting their course prior to the introduction of Rules for Award the applicable assessment conventions can be accessed via the Education Policy and Quality webpages. Students studying BSc/MEng Computer Science are required to pass CS310-30 Project and students studying BEng/BSc/MEng Computer Systems Engineering are required to pass CS351-30 Project to be considered for an Honours degree.

Students who have successfully applied for an intercalated or integrated (Study Abroad only) year must meet the progression requirements of their Second or Third year before commencing their intercalated/integrated year. Students who do not meet the progression requirement by the September Exam Board will forfeit their placement or year abroad. It is not possible to take optional reassessment during an intercalated or integrated year and the Right to Remedy will be forfeited once students are transferred onto the intercalated/integrated route.

The pass mark for Bachelors degree modules is 40% and for Integrated Masters degree (fourth year) and Postgraduate Taught degree is 50%.

These rules apply in addition to (and are not superseded by) the rules and conventions specified in the sections below.

Students must enrol on all core modules to meet the requirements for award; students must pass all core required modules to be considered for their intended award. All core modules are required core for BSc/MEng Computer Science (CS), BSc Computer Science with Business Studies (CSBS), BEng/BSc/MEng Computer Systems Engineering (CSE), MSc Computer Science and MSc Data Analytics. For BSc/MEng Discrete Mathematics (DM) First Year students, core modules from the Mathematics Institute and Department of Statistics are not required core except for MA149-15 Linear Algebra.

Students will have the Right to Remedy Failure in all failed modules without the requirement for there to be mitigating circumstances (unless the assessment is exempt*). The ability to remedy failure will be at the next available opportunity (normally the September resit period). There is no right to remedy failure at the component level (e.g., for the resubmission of coursework) if the module is passed overall. The module resit mark will be capped and, normally, fully based on the resit examination, except in modules where assessment is predominantly based on a dissertation or essay. In that case a resubmission of that component can be required.

*intercalated and integrated year modules are exempt: CS353-120 and CS354-120

Note that students who are non-finalists may receive classifications - these are simply indicative of their performance in the relevant year.

Undergraduate First Year Board of Examiners
The Summer Term meeting of the Board of Examiners is held to determine whether candidates will either:

1. be permitted to proceed to the second year of the course (with or without optional reassessment in September); or

2. be required to take further tests in September; or

3. be required to withdraw from their course of study.

 

Category 3 will typically only be assigned to students in the Summer Exam Board if they are resitting without residence. In the majority of cases, students who fail to meet the criteria for continuation when sitting their exams for the first time, will be assigned category 2.

Please ensure that you will be available early September for the resit examination period. Exam period dates are published in advance by the Modules, Marks and Assessment team on their webpages.

The September meeting of the Board of Examiners is held to consider the results of the September tests and will determine whether candidates should either:

be permitted to proceed to the second year of the course; or
be required to withdraw from their course of study.

In order to progress to the second year of a CS-based Honours degree, a candidate must pass 90 credits (including all core modules) in Year 1 with an overall year average mark of at least 40.0%.

The first year is worth 10% of your overall degree.

Undergraduate Intermediate Board of Examiners
Second Year Board of Examiners
This Board is composed of members of the Departments directly concerned with the relevant degree course. The Board of Examiners determines whether candidates will:

be permitted to proceed to the final year of a BSc Honours course (with or without optional reassessment in September); or
be permitted to proceed to the third year of an MEng degree course (with or without optional reassessment in September); or
having failed their second year examinations, be required to take further tests to be specified by the Examiners, in a final attempt (which is usually in September). Students who satisfy the Examiners in these tests will be permitted to return to the third year of their degree course; or
be required to withdraw from their course of study, with or without exit award..
In order to progress to the third year of a CS-based Honours degree, a candidate must pass 90 credits (including all core modules) in Year 2 with a year mark of at least 40.0%. To progress to the third year of the CS or CSE MEng course, the candidate must additionally have been awarded at least an Upper Second Class Honours classification by the Board of Examiners. To progress to the third year of the DM MEng course, the candidate must additionally have achieved a year mark (as defined above) of at least 65.0%.

For BSc CS, DM and BEng/BSc CSE degrees, the second year is worth 30% of your degree.

For the BSc CSBS, the second year is worth 40% of your degree.

For MEng CS, DM and CSE degrees, the second year will count 20% towards your degree.

Third Year MEng Board of Examiners
This Board is composed of members of the Departments concerned, together with one or more external examiners. The Board of Examiners determines whether candidates will:

be permitted to proceed to the final year of an MEng degree course; or
be recommended for the award of the degree of BSc with or without Honours; or
having failed their third year examinations, be permitted to take further tests to be specified by the Examiners, in a final attempt (which is usually in September) Students who satisfy the Examiners in these tests will be permitted to return to the fourth year of their degree course; or
be required to withdraw from their course of study, with or without exit award.
 

In order to progress to the fourth year of a CS or CSE MEng degree, a candidate must pass 90 credits (including all core modules) in Year 3 with a year mark of at least 40.0%. To progress to the fourth year of the DM MEng course, the candidate must additionally have achieved a year mark (as defined above) of at least 55.0%.

For an MEng CS, DM or CSE, the third year is worth 35% of your degree.

Undergraduate Final Year Assessment Conventions
The degree classification is normally performed as follows (where M is the overall degree mark):

70% ≤ M First class degree (1)

60% ≤ M < 70% Upper second class degree (2:1)

50% ≤ M < 60% Lower second class degree (2:2)

40% ≤ M < 50% Third class degree (3)

35% ≤ M < 40% Pass degree

M < 35% Fail

If a student's final overall degree mark is close to a borderline, Examination Boards apply special borderline criteria.

Undergraduate Final Year Exam Boards
Third Year BSc Board of Examiners
This Board is composed of members of the Departments concerned, together with one or more external examiners. The Board will take into account the quality of a candidate’s work throughout the degree course. It may consider the profile of marks from individual modules, and the marks obtained in Computer Science modules. The final recommendation of the Board will be that a candidate:

be awarded a degree with Honours (with or without optional reassessment in September); or
having failed their third year examinations, be permitted to take further tests to be specified by the Examiners, in a final attempt (which is usually in September); or
be required to withdraw from their course of study, with or without exit award.
The Honours class is determined by the overall degree mark but candidates must also achieve marks in that class or higher in whole modules, equating to at least 48 credits in total, and which are taken in the final two years. These modules must be CS-coded modules in the case of the CS degrees, CS- and ES- modules in the case of the CSE degrees and CS-, MA- or ST- coded modules in the case of the DM degrees.

For students to be awarded a BSc Pass degree, a candidate must have an overall degree mark of at least 35.0%, and pass whole modules equating to at least 240 credits in total, including at least 60 credits in their third year (FHEQ Level 6).

For finalist students on BSc CS and DM, and BEng CSE, the third year is worth 60% of your degree.

For finalist students on BSc CSBS, the third year is worth 50% of your degree.

For third year MEng students, the year is worth 35% of your degree.

Note that for the 2019/20 cohort (only) the weightings are 0:35:65 / 0:45:55 / 0:20:40:40.

Fourth Year MEng Board of Examiners
This Board is composed of members of the Departments concerned, together with one or more external examiners. The Board will take into account the quality of a candidate’s work throughout the degree course. It may consider the profile of marks from individual modules, and the marks obtained in Computer Science modules. The final recommendation of the Board will be that a candidate:

be awarded an MEng degree with Honours (with or without optional reassessment in September); or
having failed their fourth year examinations, be permitted to take further tests to be specified by the Examiners, in a final attempt (which is usually in September); or
be awarded a BSc degree.
For students to be awarded an MEng Honours degree, a candidate must have an overall degree mark of at least 40.0%, and pass whole modules equating to at least 360 credits in total, including at least 90 credits in the final year (FHEQ Level 7).

A candidate who has not satisfied the criteria above for an MEng Honours degree will normally be awarded a BSc Honours degree. The overall degree mark used to classify the BSc Honours degree will be the best of the overall marks calculated using year weightings of 10:30:60:0 and 10:20:35:35.

For an MEng CS, DM or CSE, the fourth year is worth 35% of your degree.

Exit Awards
In the unlikely event that a student fails to be awarded a degree, an exit award (Diploma or Certificate) may be awarded - students are directed to the Exit Awards page for details.

Prizes
A number of prizes are awarded annually including ones for the best overall graduating BSc/BEng and MEng students and for the best third year project. Often there are additional prizes sponsored by industry.

MSc Exam Board Guidelines and MSc Degree Classification
The pass mark for MSc students is 50%. The award of MSc will normally be made on successful completion of 150 credits at masters level, providing that all core modules have been passed and a mark of at least 40% is obtained in the failed module(s). The degrees of MSc with Merit and MSc with Distinction may be awarded to those candidates who demonstrate exceptional performance in both the taught and dissertation components of the course, where Merit normally equates to a year mark of 60-69%, and a Distinction a mark of 70% and above.

A Postgraduate Diploma may be awarded to candidates who fail to meet the required standard for the award of an MSc degree, but satisfy the Board of Examiners in achieving 90 credits, and a Postgraduate Certificate may be awarded for 60 credits achievement. In particular, the award of Postgraduate Diploma requires successful completion of the following core modules (for Computer Science: Research Methods (15 CATS) and Foundations of Computing (15 CATS); for Data Analytics: Research Methods (15 CATS) and Foundations of Data Analytics (15 CATS)) and 90 credits overall. A mark of at least 40% must be achieved in the failed modules. The award of Postgraduate Certificate requires successful completion of the following core module (for Computer Science: Foundations of Computing (15 CATS); for Data Analytics: Foundations of Data Analytics (15 CATS)) and 60 credits overall.

All candidates must initially register for the MSc degree course, there being no separate Postgraduate Diploma or Certificate stream.

If a student's final overall degree mark is close to a borderline, Examination Boards apply special borderline criteria.
