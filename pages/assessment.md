University Assessment Strategy
Assessment is a judgement of performance and is a critical feature of the student experience at Warwick. Assessment for the purposes of this strategy includes coursework, examinations, group work, presentations, dissertations and projects. It encompasses formative and summative assessment, assessment for learning and assessment of learning.

Commitments
The University is committed to:

encouraging the active engagement of students in their own learning;
supporting and facilitating assessment activities to improve students' learning;
providing assessments that are accessible and inclusive;
ensuring that students receive timely, meaningful feedback to progress their learning;
supporting departments and colleagues to enable them to develop innovative assessment methods;
ensuring that assessment is linked to module and course level learning outcomes;
providing assessment methods that take account of the skills and knowledge valued by potential employers.
Assessment Aims
All students will engage with a range of relevant formative and summative assessments, clearly linked to the module and course-level learning outcomes.
All assessment processes will be designed to be accessible and inclusive, and aligned with the University's Equal Opportunities Statement and all relevant equality legislation.
Formative and summative assessment will be designed to enable students to demonstrate the skills and knowledge they have acquired at both module and course level.
The feedback mechanisms in place will include guidance on how to improve performance.
Assessment processes and outcomes will be designed to enhance students' personal and professional development through the acquisition of skills.
All assessment processes will be designed to embody the underlying principles of: reliability, validity, equity, timeliness, manageability, and inclusivity.
Departmental Endorsements
The Department of Computer Science is committed to the University Assessment Strategy. Alongside this, the Department of Computer Science will aim to provide the following:

A range of assessment methods will be used, each method being appropriate for the learning outcomes of the specific module. For example,
Practical and applied skills will be assessed by methods including programming assignments, technical reports and presentations,
knowledge and problem solving may be assessed by formal examinations, example sheets and class tests,
communication skills may be assessed by technical reports, essays, presentations and group work.
Assessment of group work will include an individually assessed element, or a group submission and a peer-weighted mechanism to determine individual contributions.
Balance the distribution of submission deadlines. At the start of the academic year, the Department will publish on the Departmental intranet a list of submission deadlines, the corresponding feedback return dates and the method by which the feedback will be provided. The return of feedback will be monitored and a termly report submitted to Faculty.
Encourage healthy academic collaboration and will inform students of the difference between this and cheating. Whilst the Department encourages students to discuss concepts and ideas with their colleagues, all work submitted for assessment must be original, produced independently and not shown to others.
All assessed work submitted online will be checked for plagiarism and other forms of cheating using Turnitin and such other tools that are available.
The design of the Department’s curriculum and its assessment strategy is guided by the QAA subject benchmark and the educational requirements of the British Computer Society.

Module Assessment
The assessment of individual modules varies from being wholly continuously assessed, e.g. by coursework or project report, through a combination of continuous assessment and written examination, to being totally assessed by written examination. Each module description specifies the mode of assessment and, if it is by written examination, the time allowed for the examination.

Mark Scales
Your assessed work and exams will be marked on one of two scales depending on certain characteristics of the assessment or exam. These are the 100 point marking scheme, and the 20 point marking scale. The department or lecturer running any particular module will be able to tell you which scale applies to the module. Information on both of these scales can be found on the Universities Education Policy and Quality webpage here.

The 100 point marking scale is predominantly used for work which is numeric, contains a large number of questions or contains multiple subparts. As such, it is used for the majority of most assessments within the Department of Computer Science.

The 20 point marking scale is predominantly used for singular pieces of work. These are typically essay based assessments, dissertations and where there may not be an objective answer.

Marking ScaleLink opens in a new window

For MEng degrees for students commencing their programme of study in academic year 20/21 or later, the minimum pass mark in year 4 is 50%, unlike in the other years of study.

For MSc degrees, please see the MSc Exam Board Guidelines and MSc Degree Classification under the Exam Boards section for more information.

Examination Arrangements
Examinations for most modules in the Department of Computer Science are held during the summer examination period, Weeks 4-9 of Term 3.

Several first and second year modules in the Department of Computer Science are examined at the start of Term 3 (normally the first two weeks).

The Warwick Mathematics Institute schedule several Year 3 module examinations at the start of Term 3 (normally the first two weeks). This is likely to affect Discrete Mathematics students taking MA-coded modules.

Other departments may also hold examinations outside of the normal summer period.

Resit examinations usually take place in the first half of September.

The Examination Timetable is compiled and released by the Modules, Marks and Assessment Team and can be accessed at appropriate times. Note that the Modules, Marks and Assessment Team is responsible for scheduling exams. The Department has no control of the exact days or times of examinations in a given examination period. Although no student will have two exams at the same time, it is not uncommon to have two exams in one day and examinations on consecutive days.

The Department provides advice on approaching and feedback on performance in Computer Science - based examinations.

Calculators
The only calculators permitted in Computer Science examinations are those from the CASIO FX82, FX83 and FX85 series. These are available to purchase from some stores and online, with prices starting from £16.50.

Annual assessment
The performance of students is considered each year by the relevant Board of Examiners in late June or early July.

Results will be communicated to students via Tabula or Data Reveal. Students may obtain more detailed information about their performance by visiting their Personal Tutor.

Resits
Resits will be conducted at the earliest possible slot. This will be when the non-resit exam is set during the academic year or during the September exam block, whichever is first. Unless otherwise specified, these exams will be capped at 40% (50% for FHEQ Level 7), and will be the final attempt to pass the module. If the failed modules are ran by the Department of Computer Science, the resit will count as 100% of the module mark. This resit will often be an exam, but is dependant on the module. Different departments will have different policies on resits. As such, if you take a module from a department other than the Department of Computer Science, you should check the policies and regulations for that department.

If there are mitigating circumstances attached to a module that are deemed severe enough (see the Mitigating Circumstances page for more information) , this resit might be treated as a “Further First Attempt” (sometimes referred to as a “Further First Sit”). You will be informed if this applies to you when you are informed of your marks and resits. In these cases, the exam is uncapped, and will be recombined to form your final mark for the module. If you then failed the module again, you would be offered a capped module resit at the next opportunity. This is usually when the non-resit exam is sat during the academic year, or during the September exam block, whichever is first.

Under the Right to Remedy Failure (see the Exam Board page for more information), you will be offered resits for all modules that you failed. This is regardless of whether they are required for you to pass the year or degree. These resits are classed as “Optional Resits”, and can be done at your discretion. The Department of Computer Science will provide more information to those students whom it will apply to, after the module results have been announced.

Calculation of Year Mark (UG)
The normal load for a year’s study being 120 CATS credits and the maximum permitted load being 150 CATS credits. In some specific situations (such as specified by the Course Regulations), the standard number of CATS may be larger. For each year of study, a candidate’s Year Mark is the greater of the following two marks:

the arithmetic mean of the marks for all modules taken, weighted according to their credit weighting;
the arithmetic mean of the subset of whole modules, weighted according to their credit weighting, which satisfies the Course Regulations and results in the highest mark.
Calculation of Year Mark (MSc)
The MSc Degree year mark is calculated as a weighted average of the module marks, expressed as a percentage.

What is each year of my degree worth?
The worth or 'weighting' of each year of an undergraduate degree will depend on which programme you are on and the year in which you are studying. Note the third year for MEng students is weighted differently to the third (and final) year for BSc/BEng students.

If you are enrolled on a degree "with intercalated year" (including the HKUST exchange year), the intercalated year is weighted 0% for the purposes of calculating the overall degree mark.

Here is a summary table of the year weightings according to the degree programme:

 

Year; BSc CS, DM, BEng CSE; BSc CSBS; MEng CS, DM, CSE

Year 1; 10%; 10%; 10%

Year 2; 30%; 40%; 20%

Year 3; 60%; 50%; 35%

Year 4; -; -; 35%

Note that for the 2019/20 cohort (only) the weightings are 0:35:65 (BSc CS, DM, BEng CSE) / 0:45:55 (BSc CSBS) / 0:20:40:40 (MEng CS, DM, CSE).

When are the Exam Boards and when will I know the results?
There is a Board of Examiners who preside over the marks for each year of study. Examination boards usually take place in the last week of the third Term for Years 1, 3 and 4, and in the week after the end of Term 3 for Year 2.

Marks and classifications will be normally released to you by Tabula or Data Reveal after the examination board.

Higher Education Achievement Report (HEAR)
All undergraduate students will receive a Higher Education Achievement Report (HEAR) shortly after the end of the academic year. This is usually around the middle of August.

What is the HEAR?
The HEAR will be issued as an electronic document and will give undergraduate students a fuller record of their achievements whilst at university. It will include information about achievements such as volunteering and prizes awarded as well as information about module marks and the Degree Classification awarded. It is hoped that this additional information will prove useful to both graduates entering the job market and to employers.

What will be recorded in the HEAR?
Academic achievement including module marks and degree classification
Information about the programme of study
Additional information such as activities undertaken and prizes won
You can find more information about HEAR on the University HEAR web page.
