During your studies, you may experience exceptional unforeseen circumstances which are outside your control and might have a detrimental effect on your studies.

There are essentially four separate processes to support you in such circumstances. Please read each option carefully to identify which is the most suitable route for you and your needs.

Self-certification for deadline assessed work:

a) Extensions or

b) waivers

Extension requests (not eligible for self-certification)

Mitigating Circumstances  

Reasonable adjustments (RAs) 

Full guidance relating to mitigating circumstances can be found here: Mitigating Circumstances Guidance for Students.

Self-certifications for Assessed Work
The University's self-certification policy allows an automatic 5 university working days extension for eligible assessed work without the need for evidence.

Students can self-certify twice in a single academic year.

One self-certification request covers all the assessments that fall within the self-certification period (a self-certification period is a maximum of 5 consecutive university working days).

Issues impacting online exams and timed assessments cannot be self-certified by extension, but it may be possible for these components to be waived.

Please find the list of modules for which waivers or extensions can applied for the assessed work via self-certification.

(Note that this is a reference list for your convenience. Always consult the specific module page for the most accurate information).

Note: Ineligible components should be reported as extension requests claims (see section below). 

How to apply for a self-certified extension?

To apply for a self-certified extension/waiver, complete the self-certification form, available from the “Personal Circumstances” tab on Tabula (see hereLink opens in a new window for further details). You cannot use the ordinary extension form to apply for self-certification. “Ordinary” extensions - i.e., supported by evidence such as a medical note - will continue to be handled in the normal way through the “extension” form visible in the appropriate coursework submission page on Tabula. 

Is evidence needed to self-certify? 

No. Evidence is not required to self-certify.

Extension Requests
Students who wish to request an extension for an assessment that is not eligible for self-certification, or have exhausted their right to self-certify for assessed work, must apply for a specific extension. Such an extension request must be supported by evidence such as a medical note. 

Detailed information can be found here: Mitigating Circumstances Policy Section 4: Self-certification and extensions for deadline assessed workLink opens in a new window

How to request an extension

To request a (non-self-certifiable) extension, you will need to use the “extension form” visible in the appropriate “Assignments” submission page on Tabula (see here for further details). 

Do not use a mitigating circumstance claim to request an extension. This is not the correct route, and your request will be rejected. 

You will need to submit evidence 

For details on acceptable forms of evidence, please see the following link: Guidance on Evidence for Mitigating Circumstances 

Your request will not automatically be granted. You will receive a confirmation email if it is granted or if it is denied.

Extensions to assignments for modules from non-CS departments

You should be able to request these in the same way, through Tabula. Please refer to the relevant department’s extension requirements in their student handbooks. If a single non-CS piece of coursework has been affected by mitigating circumstances, and it does not have an option of reporting it on the module page on Tabula, please use the tab in “Personal Circumstances” (as if you were declaring for the more serious mitigating circumstances) to report it.

Mitigating Circumstances
Full guidance relating to mitigating circumstances can be found here: Mitigating Circumstances Guidance for StudentsLink opens in a new window.

The University policy on Mitigating Circumstances defines the term as relating to the following.

Situations that you could not have predicted and had no control over (for instance, serious illness, death of someone close, being the victim of a crime, family difficulties, unforeseen financial hardship, or problems with remote IT provision). 
Situations with a significant impact on your ability to undertake assessments /examinations which are normally independently evidenced in a timely fashion; (e.g. doctor’s note during illness showing duration and level of negative impact). 
Situations that are acute and which have an impact over a short period relevant to your studies (normally within three weeks of the relevant assessment event or deadline). In general terms, mitigating circumstances must be: 
Significant (they have more than a minor impact on you), 
Unexpected (you must have had no prior knowledge of the event), 
Unpreventable (there were no reasonable steps you could have taken to prevent the event), 
Relevant (you must be able to link the event, and its impact, on the period for which your claim is being made) and 
Corroborated (they must be independently verifiable and the evidence must meet the University requirements - see guidance on evidence).
How to submit a Mitigating Circumstances claim:  

On this page you can find a guide to the submission of a Mitigating Circumstances claim.

Please note that Extension Requests must NOT be submitted through the Mitigating Circumstances route. Please see the section above for more details on extension requests.

Claims which will be rejected

Full-time students are expected and required to be in the vicinity of the University of Warwick, or their normal study location if different, for the duration of the academic year and consequently mitigating circumstances claims related to being in a different location without cause will not be accepted. Please refer to the "Change Of Study Location" webpages if you are a visa sponsored student and you need to leave the UK. 

Circumstances that are within a student’s control (e.g., misreading an examination timetable, uploading an incorrect or blank file, unreadable scan quality) are not normally eligible for consideration. This includes failing to include all files within a zip file (see below). 

Claims submitted without any supporting evidence will be rejected if evidence is not uploaded 5 days after being requested.  

Mitigating circumstances claims for coursework should be submitted within 20 working days of the coursework deadline. Once marks have been officially released to you, it is too late to submit mitigating circumstances retrospectively.

Mitigating circumstances not submitted by the relevant deadline are not required to be considered by the Department and may have to be considered by an Academic Appeals Committee as part of an academic appeal, please see:

https://warwick.ac.uk/services/gov/calendar/section2/regulations/reg42academicappealsLink opens in a new window

A: In all such circumstances the exam takes precedence and will not normally eligible for consideration under the Mitigating Circumstances policy. We cannot reschedule exams, whereas an employer (who should already understand that students have exams at specific times of year) has some flexibility. You must negotiate with the employer. *1

Deadlines

If you submit your Mitigating Circumstances claim after the deadline it may not be possible to consider your claim and your claim will not be accepted unless you have good reason for the late submission. If you have missed the deadline please provide information in your claim about why you were unable to submit by the deadline. For department deadlines see “Timeliness” paragraph below.

General Rules on Mitigating Circumstances Evidence
Apart from self-certification requests, all submissions for consideration of mitigating circumstances must be accompanied by independent third-party evidence which must confirm the existence of the mitigating circumstances and state how the reported circumstances have impacted on the student’s ability to study and/or complete assessments to the best of their ability. 

Evidence must be legible and in English. Evidence obtained overseas which is written in another language should normally be accompanied by a certified translation (with any costs incurred in obtaining the evidence being borne by the student).

Students are responsible for providing acceptable and sufficient evidence. The Department will not make enquiries to obtain evidence on a student’s behalf. 

Mitigating circumstances submitted without appropriate evidence will be rejected. Detailed information on what is considered appropriate evidence can be found here: Guidance on Evidence for Mitigating CircumstancesLink opens in a new window. 

Where a reasonable adjustment does not mitigate a situation and the third-party evidence has already been seen, the student does not need to provide additional evidence. 

Confidentiality 

An exam board will not discuss an individual student’s circumstances. This will take place confidentially at a “Mitigating Circumstances Panel” (MCP) which precedes the exam board, but the exam board will be advised the extent to which the mitigating circumstances have affected the student. 

Currently a Mitigating Circumstances Panel comprises at least three of the following members of staff, as appropriate to the year of study of the student being considered. Any questions about the composition of the Panel should be directed to a Senior TutorLink opens in a new window in the first instance. Use the following link to find out which staff hold relevant Academic ResponsibilitiesLink opens in a new window.

Mike Joy, Senior Tutor (Chair) 
Rossella Suma, Senior Tutor 
Director of Undergraduate Studies, or Director of Postgraduate Teaching (as appropriate)
Director of Student Experience
The relevant examinations board chair
Administrative support 
The information you have provided on the form will be shared between those members of the Panel. If a student believes that their submission contains sensitive (or highly confidential) personal information and/or evidence, they should submit the claim through the portal as normal but ensure that they tick the box marked “I have sensitive information that I would prefer to show to a member of staff in person”. The student will be contacted by the Chair of the Mitigating Circumstances Panel or a Senior Tutor (or another member of staff if appropriate) to arrange to view the evidence. 

Timeliness 

It is the sole responsibility of the student to disclose mitigating circumstances to the Department and submit the necessary information and evidence via Tabula in a timely manner. 

While it is acknowledged that cultural attitudes to the disclosure of personal information may vary, students are expected to fully disclose all matters they wish to have taken into consideration. 

You should complete and submit the Mitigating Circumstances Declaration as soon as possible after the circumstance arises and no later than the last examination for your year of study.

For the 2024/25 academic year, the Summer 2025 in-person exam period is 12/05/2025 – 19/06/2025. The Departmental Deadlines for consideration by examination boards will be published below once the examination timetable is released w/c 21/04/2025:

Mitigating circumstances not submitted by the deadline for consideration by examination boards will not normally be considered. 

Support 

If you are considering submitting a claim for mitigating circumstances, you should certainly consult your personal tutor (or a DCS Senior TutorLink opens in a new window if your personal tutor is unavailable). You may need to speak to your GP or hospital, if your claim involves illness or accident. You can also seek advice from Wellbeing Support Services Wellbeing Support ServicesLink opens in a new window or from the SU Students Union Advice CentreLink opens in a new window on campus.

Outcomes

The mitigating circumstances panel will be guided by the following principles:

Timeliness: How close is the period of mitigating circumstances experienced to the summative assessment (essay/practical/examination)? How lengthy is the affected period? Is the time frame of the affected period supported by the evidence?
Relevance: How do the circumstances impact on the student’s ability to do the summative assessment? Does the evidence support the claim?
Severity: To what extent have the circumstances affected the student’s ability to do the summative assessment? Is this fully supported by appropriate evidence? 
For comprehensive details of potential outcomes resulting from mitigating circumstances, please refer to the following link: Mitigating Circumstances Policy Section 7: OutcomesLink opens in a new window

The panel will normally only consider assessments that have been claimed by the student on the mitigating circumstances form. 

The decision of the panel will only be based on the evidence that has been presented to the panel for consideration in the original submission. 

The outcome of the submission will normally only be confirmed after the exam boards have met, since the panel “recommends” an outcome to the exam board, and it is the exam board which makes the decision. 

Reconsideration of mitigating circumstances will be made based on new evidence only. A student who has additional evidence available should submit a new mitigating circumstances claim. 

If a student believes that there has been a procedural error in the recommended outcome and/or the application of the recommended outcome (e.g. have been informed that their claim has been accepted, but they have not been entered for a further first attempt on a failed module), they should email dcs.ug.support@warwick.ac.ukLink opens in a new window (UG students) ordcs.pgt.support@warwick.ac.uk Link opens in a new window(PGT students) to ask for clarification.

Contact should normally be made within 10 working days of the results release to enable correction of errors.

Students who are eligible to appeal their academic progression or classification decision following the Board of Examiners and are in possession of new evidence that was not previously available to the Board of Examiners should note that they may not receive a mitigating circumstances decision by the deadline for appeal submission. Consequently, students in this position are advised also to submit an appeal. 

Please note the following: 

The Department does not offer resits in coursework components;
A recommendation to raise marks will not be made under any circumstances.
A recommendation will not be made to enter a student for reassessment (either further first attempt or resit) in a module that has already been passed, under any circumstances. 



Reasonable Adjustments 
Prolonged, long-term or chronic conditions are not normally considered a basis for mitigating circumstances. Students with a chronic illness or disability, of a duration normally greater than a term, are advised to access Wellbeing Support ServicesLink opens in a new window which can put in place Reasonable Adjustments for specific learning requirements and examinations.

Reasonable adjustments refer to modifications or accommodations made to ensure that you have equal access to education and an inclusive learning environment. These adjustments are considered on an individual basis and are intended to level the playing field, mitigate the impact of your condition, and support you in your academic pursuits.



What to do if you require reasonable adjustments 

Students who require Reasonable Adjustments should contact Wellbeing Support Services to arrange a meeting with a disability adviser to discuss what reasonable adjustments may be helpful. Adjustments are considered on an individual basis and considered in the context of the impact of a disability or learning difference, University policies and the Equality Act (2010).Link opens in a new window Once a student has met with the disability team, the adviser will contact the department (with permission) to put forward any specific adjustments. Although adjustments vary, it is not unusual for recommendations to be made relating to marking, deadlines, recording of lectures and access to lecture materials in advance.

Please note that any adjustments that were in place at your previous education provider will not have been transferred forward to the University of Warwick.

I have declared a disability to the University. Will this be taken into consideration when I sit my exams?

If you require alternative exam arrangements on disability grounds, please note that these are not automatically put in place if you have declared a disability, you must make an appointment with the Disability Team to discuss your requirements before these can be agreed (see the “Alternative Exam Arrangements” section below).



If I have reasonable adjustments in place, may I also submit mitigating circumstances in support of my declared condition?  

If you have a condition which has been dealt with through reasonable adjustments/alternative exam arrangements, you cannot also claim mitigating circumstances for the same condition. However, the timing of the diagnosis, or a marked deterioration or flare up of an existing condition, may be considered a basis for mitigating circumstances. For example, a late diagnosis which means that reasonable adjustments cannot be made, or an existing condition worsens and is not covered by the reasonable adjustments already in place. 

Full details can be found here: Reasonable Adjustments.

Alternative Exam Arrangements

If you require alternative exam arrangements on disability grounds, please make an appointment with the Disability Team (through Wellbeing Support Services) as soon as you can. Following that discussion and with your consent, your Department and the Exams Office will be informed of any adjustments required for examinations. Any disability related arrangements will be put in place for the duration of your course and you don’t have to renew them every year unless you believe your support requirements should be reviewed because of a change in your condition or circumstances. In that instance, please contact the Disability Team to discuss any required changes.


Please note that there are specific deadlines for alternative exam arrangementsLink opens in a new window. Requests for alterative exam arrangements outside these deadlines cannot be accommodated for the current academic year, unless there are exceptional and unforeseen circumstances that would have prevented students from engaging with us within these deadlines. 

Temporary Withdrawal 
In the event of a prolonged illness or other circumstances that seriously affect your studies it may be appropriate to consider withdrawing temporarily from the University, to return at approximately the same point in a subsequent year, when the problem is resolved. Experience shows that this is often a better course of action than ‘struggling on’. If you think this may be an appropriate course of action then you should consult your personal tutor at the earliest opportunity.

For further information regarding temporary withdrawal see: https://warwick.ac.uk/services/academicoffice/studentrecords/twdLink opens in a new window

Submission of Zip Files 
If you are required to submit a zip archive to include an item of coursework, please be very careful to ensure that your zip file contains all the files required. 

For example, suppose you have a folder my-cs999-files containing your files for module cs999, and the folder contains sub-folders (which it probably will), then you need to create the zip file “recursively”. So, if your archive is named john-smith-cs999.zip, the appropriate command on Linux is:
zip -r john-smith-cs999 my-cs999-files
If you omit the -r option it will not traverse the whole folder and your archive will be incomplete.

Uploading the Wrong File
If you notice that you have uploaded the wrong file, please email the programmes team (dcs.ug.support@warwick.ac.uk or dcs.pgt.support@warwick.ac.uk.), who will be able to assist you with the removal of your current file, allowing you to upload the correct file. Please note, that if this is after the deadline, you will incur in a late penalty. 

Support 
If you are considering submitting a claim for mitigating circumstances, you should certainly consult your personal tutor (or a DCS Senior Tutor if your personal tutor is unavailable). You may need to speak to your GP or hospital, if your claim involves illness or accident. You can also seek advice from Wellbeing Support Services or from the Students Union Advice Centre on campus.

Previous Years’ Policies 
Please note that this page reflects the University's mitigating circumstances policy for the academic year commencing October 2024. For the policy (forms, etc.) for the period ending 30 September 2024, please consult last year's handbook. The full policy is available here.
